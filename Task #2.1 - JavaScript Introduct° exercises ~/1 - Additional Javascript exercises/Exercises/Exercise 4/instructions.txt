- Given this data.js, make a table for every person.
- You need to add two checkboxes for the gender "Male" and "Female".
- Every time that you check one of these checkboxes, you need to filter
for its value. For example if I check the "Male" checkbox only the Males appears.
- Once this is done, you need to create a Dropdown with two conditions:
    - Older than 30
    - Younger than 30
- Only the members that acomplish this values need to be showed.

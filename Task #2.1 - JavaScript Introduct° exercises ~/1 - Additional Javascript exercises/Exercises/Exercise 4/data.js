// - Given this data.js, make a table for every person.
// - You need to add two checkboxes for the gender "Male" and "Female".
// - Every time that you check one of these checkboxes, you need to filter for its value.
//   For example if I check the "Male" checkbox only the Males appears.
// - Once this is done, you need to create a Dropdown with two conditions:
//     - Older than 30
//     - Younger than 30
// - Only the members that accomplish this values need to be showed

Make a function for show a random image in a div in the center of the page.
You have the images in the 'images' folder in the root directory.

You need a 'Randomize' button under the div with the image that
makes the action...

Ok this is the last one!

I need a button that every time is clicked, adds a new row in a table.
But I need that adds a new row with a random color background.

It's sounds hard but remember to think in little.

In your HTML create an input field, a button with the text "Add" and an empty div under them.

Create a function for every time that I press the Add button, the value of the input
have to be appended in the empty div.
If the input is empty (witouth any text), and the user press the Add button, an alert
should be shown with an advertising text.

Good luck.

Create a function to fill an array with 100 random numbers. You can't create it manually.

After this, make another function that separate the numbers of the first array in two new arrays:
    var oddNumbers = [];
    var evenNumbers = [];

You have to console.log these two arrays after create them.

In this exercise, you need to make some interesting things.
First of all take a look at the html. You'll find three different divs with three different buttons.
Every time that you click every button, "his" div needs to slideDown. (see jquery .slideDown() method).
But here is the trickest thing. When you click any button, if some div is hidden, must to be shown again.
For example: If you click the first button, the first div must be slideDown. If yo click the second button now,
the second div dissapears but the first one must appears.
ONLY the div that has clicked in last, have to be "hidden".
Think about it.
You only can make ONE function for all the buttons.

Clue: Play with classes and "THIS" object.

Good luck!!
